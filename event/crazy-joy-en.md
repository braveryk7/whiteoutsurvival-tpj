# Crazy Joy
Crazy Joy is a pseudo-battle event with NPCs.

It unlocks at the Great Smelting Furnace Level 22, offering a large number of enhancement items for "Lord Equipment."

Additionally, you can obtain a significant amount of alliance coins necessary for advanced city relocation, acceleration items, and shield items.

## Participation Conditions
* Only alliance leaders with Great Smelting Furnace Lv7 or higher can participate

## Rules
* During defense, if you defeat more than 50% of the marauders, it's considered a successful defense
* You can reinforce other members within the alliance
* Reinforced members can earn points separately from the city's lord
* If you fail to defend twice, there will be no more attacks at that level
* Levels 7/14/17 feature stronger Elite Marauders compared to others
* Levels 7/14/17 marauders are dispatched only to online members at that time
* At levels 10/20, marauders are dispatched to the Snowfield Alliance Headquarters
* Rewards are distributed 12 hours after the event ends

## Rewards
* Polishing Agents
* Tough Alloys
* Alliance Coins
* Resources (Wood, Meat, Coal, Iron Ore)

## Notes
* Shields are unnecessary
* If you fail to defend, your city will burn, but only for 30 minutes per failure
* Failing twice results in a total of 1 hour of burning
* The city wall's durability decreases by 240 for 30 minutes of burning, totaling a 480 decrease for two failures
* Fires can be extinguished with diamonds, but durability can be restored without them
* City wall durability can be restored at no cost from the city wall -> city defense menu

# Strategy Details
Crazy Joy is a defense event, so protecting your city is crucial.

An important rule is that you earn points if you successfully defend, even if you don't defeat a single enemy.

A technique for this is to empty your city (send all troops to another alliance member's city) and have other members defend your city.

1. Send your strongest main force as reinforcements to a nearby city
2. Send the rest of your troops as reinforcements to other alliance members' cities
3. At the timing of the level 10/20 headquarters attack, summon your main force and send it to the headquarters
4. After level 10 is over, immediately summon and send them again as reinforcements to a nearby city

Using this method, someone else's reinforcements will protect your city, earning you points automatically, and you'll also receive points for defending someone else's city.

Sending all troops as reinforcements benefits everyone, as it doesn't reduce the city lord's points.

However, it's not immediately apparent which city is empty, so please request reinforcements in the alliance chat (a simple "please send reinforcements" is fine).

Of course, if no reinforcements arrive at your city after you've sent all your troops to another alliance, you'll quickly fail.

## Preparation
Crazy Joy usually starts at 22:05.

Recall troops that are gathering and avoid forming new gatherings after 21:55.

Start preparing to send reinforcements around 21:50, and it's helpful if you request reinforcements in the alliance chat.

## Attacks on Online Members
Attacks on online members at levels 7/14/17 only occur if you are online, meaning the game must be open.

Ensure you have the game screen open.

## Headquarters Defense
During headquarters defense, if possible, use all shield troops.

In Crazy Joy, shield troops seem to earn more points in defense events.

If you don't have enough shield troops, send the next lower grade of shield troops, or spearmen if still insufficient.

Archers are not helpful.

However, depending on the hero's expedition skills, spearmen might rapidly defeat enemies and earn a lot of points.

## If You Fail Twice
Even if you fail to defend twice, attacks on other alliance members will continue.

Therefore, keep sending reinforcements to other cities until the event ends.

You can also participate in the level 10/20 headquarters defense.

## Repairing City Walls
City wall repairs can restore 240 points per repair.

The durability loss from burning for 30 minutes after a failed defense is also 240 points.

Therefore, you don't need to extinguish the fire immediately; wait 30 minutes, repair, and after two failures, another 30 minutes later, you can fully recover.

If the city wall's durability reaches 0, your city will be randomly relocated.

To avoid this and the need for advanced city relocation, upgrade your city walls.
