# Alliance Total Mobilization
This event involves all alliance members undertaking various quests and competing with other alliances based on the total points earned by all members.

The rewards are substantial, and since it can be done alongside daily routines, active participation is encouraged.

## Participation Conditions
* Only alliance leaders with Great Smelting Furnace Lv10 or higher can participate
* A minimum of 15 alliance members is required
* If you change or leave the alliance during the event period, you will not receive any rewards

## Rules
* Alliance Total Mobilization is held every two weeks
* Quests can be undertaken from the event tab, and completing them earns points
* The top two quests in the quest column are exclusive to you, while the others are shared quests for all alliance members
* Every day at UTC 0:00 (JST 9:00), you receive one ticket necessary for undertaking quests
* To undertake more quests, 1-3 tickets cost 50 diamonds each, and any more will cost 200 diamonds each
* Exclusive quests can be cleared up to twice a day per square
* Exclusive quests can be refreshed; if not cleared, a 2-minute interval is required, and if cleared, a 5-minute interval is needed
* Shared quests come with 120% and 200% bonuses
* The 200% bonus is available once a day, and the 120% bonus applies to the remaining three times
* Members ranked R4 and above can refresh shared quests
* To receive all alliance rewards, 1,200 points must be earned
* If the alliance ranks 3rd or higher, it will be promoted to a higher league; if 18th or lower, it will be demoted to a lower league

## Rewards
* Refining Energy Source Stones
* Diamonds
* Acceleration Items
* Legend Exploration/Expedition Skill Books

## Notes
* You must earn at least 1,200 points individually to receive alliance rewards
* If you accidentally undertake a quest, it can be reset, but the number of attempts will be consumed
* The 200% bonus for exclusive quests is available once a day
* Therefore, it's advisable to use the 200% bonus on high-point quests like soldier training/promotion of 120,000 points

# Strategy Details
The most important thing is to refresh your exclusive quests daily to undertake good quests.

* Soldier Training/Promotion
* Beast/Giant Beast Subjugation
* Resource Gathering
* Consumption of Acceleration Items
* Lord Equipment Enhancement
* Diamond Consumption
* Purchase of Packs Including Diamonds (In-App Purchases)
* Consumption of Legend Hero Fragments
* Consumption of Hero Equipment Refining Energy Stones
* Fire Crystal Consumption (only for lords with fire crystal levels)
* Lord Gem Enhancement (only in higher leagues)

Below is an explanation of recommended quests.

## Recommended Quests

|Recommended Quest|Reason|
|:--:|---|
|Soldier Training/Promotion|No item use required; just train/promote to complete the quest while idle, and it also boosts total strength. This alone is enough.|
|Giant Beast Subjugation|If there's nothing else to undertake, just set it to auto-join subjugation to complete.|
|Consumption of Acceleration Items|Acceleration items efficiently earn points, so save them for use during Alliance Total Mobilization.|
|Lord Equipment Enhancement|If you've been saving lord equipment enhancement items for events, this is an easy way to earn points.|
|Consumption of Legend Hero Fragments|Alliance Total Mobilization excludes rare/epic heroes, so use those in other events and save legend fragments for this event.|
|Consumption of Hero Equipment Refining Energy Stones|Though legend equipment is hard to obtain, refining energy stones are easily acquired through bear traps, making it easy to earn high points.|

|Not Recommended Quest|Reason|
|:--:|---|
|Beast Subjugation|The points are overwhelmingly low compared to the number of beasts defeated. Giant beast subjugation, which can be done automatically, is far better. (Worth considering if you pay for auto-hunting.)|
|Resource Gathering|Same as above.|
|Diamond Consumption|If there's a concurrent diamond consumption event, it's viable; otherwise, it's not advisable to consume a large amount of diamonds (better used for things like Lucky Roulette).|
|Purchase of Packs Including Diamonds|Good if you plan to make in-app purchases, but not necessary just for quest completion.|

### Soldier Training/Promotion
The "Increase total strength by ◯◯ points through soldier training/promotion" quest is highly recommended.

It's the only quest where you can earn high points without item consumption.

There are two types: 30,000 points and 120,000 points.

For example, for 120,000 points, training level 8 soldiers earns 38 points per soldier.

Therefore, training 1,053 soldiers each in shield/spear/bow barracks achieves 120,000 points.
(1053×38＝40,014 points × 3 barracks ＝ 120,042 points)

* Check exclusive quests in the morning and keep refreshing until you get soldier training/promotion
* Keep refreshing until you get a 200% bonus
* Undertake the 120,000 points soldier training/promotion quest and send out full training
* After training is complete, subtract the number of soldiers just trained from 1,053 and complete the remaining training
* Once training is complete, if it's a 120,000 points quest with a 200% bonus, you'll earn 860 points

Doing this for two days easily achieves the individual 1,200 points, securing all alliance rewards.

Of course, to get all individual rewards, you'll need more points, so supplement with other quests.

### Lord Equipment Enhancement / Legend Hero Fragments / Hero Equipment Refining Energy Stones
These are also excellent choices.

These often become conditions in other events, so you need to be mindful to save them, but if you have them, definitely use them during Alliance Total Mobilization.

Especially for hero fragments, other events include rare and epic heroes, but Alliance Total Mobilization only includes legends.

Save legend hero fragments and prioritize using rare and epic ones in other events, saving legends for Alliance Total Mobilization.

### Consumption of Acceleration Items
Actively use acceleration items.

Especially efficient is the flow of acceleration quests for soldier training/promotion speed up → then soldier training/promotion quests, clearing two quests in one go.

Mass promoting low-level soldiers can significantly boost your strength.

Research and construction also directly link to strength, so use any spare acceleration items.

Note that there are acceleration quests for all types of acceleration and specific ones for construction, research, and soldiers.

The all-acceleration type allows combining multiple accelerations, but the points are slightly higher for the specific acceleration types.

### Giant Beast Subjugation
Highly recommended when you're short on time.

While the points might be a bit low, for example, doing it before bed might mean it's completed by morning.

Also, you can start soldier training in the morning without undertaking that quest, instead undertaking giant beast subjugation, and by the time training is done, the subjugation quest is likely completed, allowing you to then undertake and complete the soldier training quest.

It's a convenient quest when you're pressed for time.

### Not Recommended Quests
The quests listed in the table above as not recommended generally don't need to be undertaken.

Resource gathering might seem good as it can be done passively, but giant beast subjugation, which is also passive, offers higher points.

Diamond consumption is only advisable if there's a concurrent event requiring massive diamond use; otherwise, it's not recommended to consume diamonds just for Alliance Total Mobilization.

Lords ranked R4 and above with the authority to refresh shared quests are advised to prioritize refreshing these quests.
